# A Babel Plugin for `throw cancel` and `catch cancel`

This Babel plugin implements the language extensions from ["Canceled as a third state"](https://github.com/domenic/cancelable-promise/blob/master/Third%20State.md), in particular the `throw cancel` and `catch cancel` language extensions. It's very rough and exists only in service of some experiments I'm doing, so be careful.
